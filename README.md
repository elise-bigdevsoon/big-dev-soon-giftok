## Hello to [BigDevSoon](https://bigdevsoon.me/) ðŸ‘‹

Create code that matters! ðŸ¤©

Level up your coding skills by building real-world projects with professional designs.

## Project brief

Unfold the dynamic universe of **GifTok**, a platform designed for boundless GIF exploration. Transitioning gracefully between mobile and desktop layouts, GifTok offers an uninterrupted flow of visual narratives, taking users on a captivating journey through the best of what the GIF world has to offer.

### What you will learn

- **API Mastery**: Dive deep into the realms of the Giphy API. Learn to navigate its endpoints, manage API keys securely, and seamlessly weave raw data into captivating visuals for your audience.

- **Responsive Evolution**: Begin with the mobile landscape, showcasing singular GIFs, then elevate your design to cater to the expansive desktop environment, all while maintaining a cohesive user experience.

- **User Experience Delight**: Implement intricate UI features such as skeleton loading animations and infinite scrolling. Understand Let the users navigate through thousands of GIFs.

- **Edge Case Excellence**: Dive into the challenges of real-world applications by handling scenarios such as error boundaries, and data limitations, and ensuring a smooth user journey from start to finish.

### Requirements

- Research and explore the [Giphy API's](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint/#trending) trending endpoint, which can return a maximum of 25 GIFs at once and has an offset limit of up to 5000 GIFs. Study [The GIF Object](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/schema/#gif-object) and store the API key securely as an environment variable.
- Implement the mobile version of GifTok, starting with displaying a single GIF from the trending endpoint.
- Enable loading more GIFs by utilizing parameters such as limit and offset, allowing users to swipe to view the next GIF.
- Implement swipe functionality to enable users to navigate back to the previous GIF, ensuring it stops at the first GIF when reaching the beginning.
- Load more GIFs as the user approaches the end to provide a seamless transition, allowing for infinite scrolling until no more GIFs are available (which is unlikely to occur with 5000 possible GIFs).
- Display the user's avatar URL, username, and GIF title in the bottom-left corner of the GIF.
- Implement skeleton loading animations while new GIFs are being loaded to enhance the user experience during fast swiping.
- Develop the desktop version of GifTok, either utilizing the [Giphy Grid](https://github.com/Giphy/giphy-js/blob/master/packages/react-components/README.md#grid) component or a custom implementation, displaying skeleton loaders as GIFs load, and providing an animated loader when scrolling for more GIFs. Show user details and GIF titles on hover, similar to the mobile version.
- Handle edge cases such as no more GIFs to load, error handling, and other potential scenarios that may arise.

## Project assets

Depending on the mode you pick, different assets will be available:

**Freerun Mode**: In this mode (costs 1 BigToken), most of the Frontend cards you will work on come with a unique screenshot reflecting the card's requirements. These visual aids guide you toward a closer representation of the project's intended design and specifications.

**Speedrun Mode**: Access general project assets and the starter code. This mode swiftly challenges you, emphasizing the coding process over strict design adherence.

**Additional Resource â€“ Figma Design**: For those seeking a deeper dive, you have the option to download the Figma design (costs 3 BigTokens) in either Speedrun or Freerun mode.
